# Running this project

These demo steps assume that you are using a Windows 10 machine. 
Demo link: https://youtu.be/gGyDyFNz2hM
Complete code repository: https://github.com/erick016/facemask-detector 
Our code isolated for reading purposes (only what we wrote): https://github.com/JackWang071/CS688-Facemask-Detection
These are the steps to set up the run environment, with the correct dependencies, for the demo:
Use Windows PowerShell to git clone the uTensor Helloworld and Create-Face-Data-from-Images repos
Download the Real-Time-Medical-Mask-Detection dataset in Github
Extract Real-Time-Medical-Mask-Detection directly inside the root directory of uTensor Helloworld
Move poll_and_send.py to Create-Face-Data-from-Images root directory
Replace default uTensor main.cpp with custom main_original.cpp file
Move mask_conv.ipynb to root directory of uTensor Helloworld, this notebook takes a custom image set as input
Install Anaconda 3, November 2020 version
Open Anaconda Powershell in administrator mode
Create new Python 3.6.8 environment, run: 
conda create -n myenv python=3.6.8 --no-default-packages
conda activate myenv
Use pip to install the following dependencies:
pip install mbed-cli
pip install utensor-cgen jupyterlab
pip install -Iv pyelftools==0.25
pip install -Iv protobuf==3.11.3
pip install -Iv opencv-python==4.5.1.48
pip install -Iv pyserial==3.5
pip install -Iv pillow==8.0.1
pip install -Iv tensorflow==2.1.0
Open mask_conv.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook, 
jupyter notebook mask_conv.ipynb
Go to Kernel in the main menu, restart and run all cells to build the neural network using the MaskedFace-Net dataset images. This should generate a my_model.cpp file inside the uTensor directory. Press Ctrl+C on the Anaconda Powershell to exit.
Before compiling, run this command:
pip install mbed-greentea
This will make sure the board changes the led from red to green when it finishes compiling
Unfortunately, the video doesnâ€™t show this and was only caught after the recording. It did not affect the outcome but will explain why the led stays red after compiling. I tested it myself and it worked the same before and after installing mbed-greentea
To compile and install the neural network into the ST board, run this command: 
mbed deploy (only necessary the first time)
mbed compile -m auto -t GCC_ARM -f

Check the PATH environment variable, make sure that the folder containing the GCC_ARM binary is there. Use the following command in case it is not:
mbed config -G GCC_ARM_PATH "C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\6 2017-q2-update\bin"
